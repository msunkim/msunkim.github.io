		<h2> About me</h2>
		<p>
			I have joined the Department of Mathematics, Gachon University in March 2021.<br>
			I am mainly interested in cryptographic mechanics of secure computation such as MPC and HE.<br>
			More specifically, my interest is two-folds: 
			<ul>
				<li>Cryptographic Primitives</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Cryptographic gadgets for efficient MPC</li>
					<li>Dynamic searchable encryption</li>
					<li>Efficient ADSs for verifiable DB queires/li>
				</ul>
				<li>Cryptographic Applications</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Privacy and integrity in set operations over dynamic sets</li>
					<li>Privacy-preserving data mining</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			Currently, I am focusing on developing new primitives for PPSO and ADS for Join queries with verifiability.<br><br>
		

			I graduated from Seoul National University in 2012, under the supervision of Prof. Jung Hee Cheon.<br>
			My PhD thesis is on the "<a href="./thesis/CryptoShuffleAndApp.pdf">Cryptographic Shuffles and their Applications</a>".<br>
            Previously, I was working for Department of information Security, the University of Suwon, to March, 2021.<br>
            Until 2007, I was a senior engineer at Connectivity Lab., DM R&D Center at Samsung Electronics.<br>

			암호기법의 설계 및 구현에 관심이 있는 학부생 또는 대학원을 진학하려는 학생을 찾고 있습니다. 현재는 동형암호 (Homomorphic encryption)나 탐색암호 (Searchable encryption)을  
			응용한 응용 시스템과 영지식증명 (Zero-knowledge proofs) 시스템에 대한 연구를 진행하고 있습니다. 관심있는 학생은 msunkim@gachon.ac.kr로 이메일을 보내주세요.
